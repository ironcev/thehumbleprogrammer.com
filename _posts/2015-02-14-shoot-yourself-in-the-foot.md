:-)

One could easily misunderstood this quote.

[MSDN Magazine](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/) is know for its high quality articles on various topics. I read it on a regular basis and would recommend it to every programmer who uses Microsoft technology stack.

Why then the quote?

Well, I've just stumbled upon it while reading [that old article](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/APIWar.html) of Joel Spolsky. I liked how Joel formulated it. It made me laugh :-) I see a lot of truth in it. It reminded me on all those technologies we were bombed with and suddenly no one seems to talk about them any more.

For me, the message behind the quote is - [cum grano salis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grain_of_salt). Always take things with a grain of salt. No matter if it is a convincing MSDN article or a strongly opinionated blog post of an influencer.

Otherwise, you could easily shoot yourself in the foot.
